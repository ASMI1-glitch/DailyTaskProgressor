        num=n%10;
        res+=num;
        num=num/10;
    }
    return res;
    
}
console.log(reverseamber(452)); what wrong here
ChatGPT said:
Good question 👍 — yes, there are multiple issues in your code. Let’s go step by step 👇

❌ Problems in your code:
num and res are not initialized properly.

let num, res;
→ This means both start as undefined, so any arithmetic on them will give NaN.

The while condition is wrong:

while(num < 0)
→ Since num is undefined (and later even if assigned positive values), this loop will never run.
You probably meant to loop while n > 0, to keep extracting digits.

Logic to reverse digits is incorrect:

You’re not actually constructing the reversed number correctly.

You’re trying to use num for both remainder and divisor.

✅ Correct version:
Here’s a fixed and clean version of your function:

function reverseamber(n) {
  let res = 0;
  while (n > 0) {
    let digit = n % 10;   // get last digit
    res = res * 10 + digit;  // build reversed number
    n = Math.floor(n / 10);  // remove last digit
  }
  return res;
}

console.log(reverseamber(452));  // Output: 254
💡 Explanation:
Step	n	digit (n % 10)	res (res * 10 + digit)
1	452	2	2
2	45	5	25
3	4	4	254
Finally, it returns 254.

Would you like me to show how to handle negative numbers or numbers ending with zeros (like 120 → 21) too?

You said:
python equivalent
ChatGPT said:
Sure 👍 Here’s the Python equivalent of that corrected JavaScript function:

def reverseamber(n):
    res = 0
    while n > 0:
        digit = n % 10        # get last digit
        res = res * 10 + digit  # build reversed number
        n = n // 10           # remove last digit (integer division)
    return res

print(reverseamber(452))  # Output: 254
💡 Explanation:
Step	n	digit (n % 10)	res (res * 10 + digit)
1	452	2	2
2	45	5	25
3	4	4	254
Final output → 254

If you also want it to handle negative numbers, here’s a slightly improved version:

def reverseamber(n):
    sign = -1 if n < 0 else 1
    n = abs(n)
    res = 0
    while n > 0:
        res = res * 10 + n % 10
        n //= 10
    return sign * res

print(reverseamber(-452))  # Output: -254
Would you like me to show how to do it in one line using string slicing too (for comparison)?

You said:
for negative we can do one thing also  like we ignore the sign by check if first less than if its less than 0 then math.abs() then perform same reverse operation on it like for posirive and we can store sign also and just put t when returning?
ChatGPT said:
Exactly ✅ — you’ve got the right logic and that’s actually the clean, common approach used in both Python and JavaScript.

Let’s restate what you said, clearly and neatly 👇

💡 Concept:
Check the sign of the number.

If it’s negative, store the sign separately (e.g., sign = -1), and take its absolute value (ignore the sign for reversal).

Reverse the digits as if it’s a positive number.

Reapply the sign when returning the result.

✅ Python Example:
def reverseamber(n):
    # Step 1: Check and store sign
    sign = -1 if n < 0 else 1

    # Step 2: Work with absolute value
    n = abs(n)
    
    # Step 3: Reverse digits
    res = 0
    while n > 0:
        res = res * 10 + n % 10
        n //= 10

    # Step 4: Reapply sign
    return sign * res

print(reverseamber(452))   # 254
print(reverseamber(-452))  # -254
🔍 How it works for -452:
Step	n	digit	res	sign
Init	452	–	0	-1
1	452	2	2	-1
2	45	5	25	-1
3	4	4	254	-1
Final	–	–	254	-1
Return → sign * res = -1 * 254 = -254

Would you like me to show the string-slicing shortcut version too (which is one-liner and Pythonic)?

You said:
same program in java
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 — here’s the same logic implemented in Java, handling both positive and negative numbers just like your Python version.

✅ Java Code:
class Main {
    public static int reverseamber(int n) {
        // Step 1: Check and store the sign
        int sign = (n < 0) ? -1 : 1;

        // Step 2: Work with absolute value
        n = Math.abs(n);

        // Step 3: Reverse digits
        int res = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            int digit = n % 10;
            res = res * 10 + digit;
            n = n / 10;
        }

        // Step 4: Reapply sign
        return sign * res;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(reverseamber(452));   // Output: 254
        System.out.println(reverseamber(-452));  // Output: -254
    }
}
💡 Explanation:
Step	n	digit	res	sign
Init	452	–	0	+1
1	452	2	2	+1
2	45	5	25	+1
3	4	4	254	+1
Final	–	–	254	+1
For -452, the same logic applies but the sign becomes -1, so final result = -254.

Would you like me to modify this Java version to handle integer overflow safely (like reversing 1534236469 should return 0)? That’s a common interview twist.

You said:
if let res; and directly using res=res*10 + n%10 then ? what happen
ChatGPT said:
Excellent question 👏 — this is about variable initialization and usage in Java, and it’s a very common beginner trap.

Let’s unpack it clearly 👇

❌ If you write:
int res;
res = res * 10 + n % 10;  // ❌
Then you’ll get a compile-time error:

error: variable res might not have been initialized
💡 Why?
In Java:

Local variables (declared inside a method) must be initialized before use.

Java does not automatically assign a default value (like 0) to local variables.

So when you write:

int res;
res has no value yet.
Then when you do:

res = res * 10 + n % 10;
Java says:

“Wait, you’re trying to use res before it’s initialized!”

That’s why the compiler stops you.

✅ Correct way:
You must initialize it first:

int res = 0;
while (n > 0) {
    res = res * 10 + n % 10;
    n = n / 10;
}
Now it’s fine — because res starts from 0, and Java knows it’s safe to use.

⚙️ Note:
If you declared res as a class field (not inside a method), Java would automatically initialize it to 0, but inside methods (local scope), you must explicitly assign it before using.

Summary:

Situation	Allowed?	Why
int res; res = res * 10 + n % 10;	❌	res not initialized
int res = 0; res = res * 10 + n % 10;	✅	initialized properly
static int res; (class field)	✅	defaults to 0 automatically
Would you like me to show what happens if you do the same thing in Python or JavaScript? (It behaves very differently there.)

ChatGPT said:
Nice 👏 you’re almost right — but your JavaScript code has a small off-by-one error in the loop condition.

Let’s fix that first, then see the Python and Java equivalents.

⚠️ Problem in your code
for (let i = 2; i < Math.sqrt(n); i++)
👉 You should loop up to and including √n, because factors can exist exactly at √n.
For example, for n = 9, √9 = 3, but your loop runs only i = 2, so it will incorrectly return true.

✅ Correct JavaScript version
function isprime(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return false; // 0 and 1 are not prime
  for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
    if (n % i === 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

console.log(isprime(8)); // false
console.log(isprime(7)); // true
🔹 Python Equivalent
import math

def isprime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

print(isprime(8))  # False
print(isprime(7))  # True
🔹 Java Equivalent
class Main {
    public static boolean isPrime(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) return false;
        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(isPrime(8));  // false
        System.out.println(isPrime(7));  // true
    }
}
✅ Summary:

Language	Key Difference
JavaScript	Use Math.sqrt() and ===
Python	Use math.sqrt() and range(2, int(...)+1)
Java	Use Math.sqrt() and proper type (boolean)

ChatGPT said:
✅ Yes — your Python syntax and logic are 100% correct!

Let’s go over it line by line so you understand each part clearly 👇

🔍 Line-by-line explanation
import math
Imports the math module so you can use functions like math.sqrt() for square root.

def isprime(n):
Defines a function named isprime that takes an integer n as input.

    if n <= 1:
        return False
Numbers 0 and 1 (and any negatives) are not prime, so return False.

    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
Loops from 2 up to and including the integer value of √n.

The +1 is needed because range excludes the end value.
Example: if n = 9, math.sqrt(9) = 3, and we want to test i = 2 and i = 3.

        if n % i == 0:
            return False
Checks divisibility.

If n is divisible by any i in that range, it’s not prime, so return False.

    return True
If the loop finishes without finding any divisor, the number is prime.

print(isprime(8))  # False
print(isprime(7))  # True
Prints test cases:

8 → not prime → False

7 → prime → True

✅ Output:

False
True
So yes — your function is syntactically and logically perfect in Python 💯

Would you like me to show how to make it more efficient (e.g., skip even numbers after 2)?

You said:
i didnt get for in python
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 — let’s slow down and break down the for loop in Python step by step, especially how it works in your code:

🔹 The line:
for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
means:

“Start from 2, and go up to (but not including) int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1.”

🔍 Example 1: Let’s say n = 8
math.sqrt(8) → 2.828...

int(math.sqrt(8)) + 1 → 2 + 1 = 3

So the loop becomes:

for i in range(2, 3):  # i = 2 only
That means the loop runs once with i = 2.

Inside loop:

if 8 % 2 == 0 → True → return False

✅ So output → False.

🔍 Example 2: Let’s say n = 7
math.sqrt(7) → 2.645...

int(math.sqrt(7)) + 1 → 2 + 1 = 3

So the loop:

for i in range(2, 3):  # i = 2 only
Inside loop:

if 7 % 2 == 0 → False → loop ends.

No divisor found → return True.

✅ So output → True.

💡 General idea:
range(start, stop) in Python:

Starts from start

Ends before stop

In your code, you add +1 to include the integer part of √n

🧠 Quick analogy:
If you write:

for i in range(2, 6):
    print(i)
Output will be:

2
3
4
5
👉 Notice how it stops before 6.

That’s exactly why we write +1 in:

range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1)
to include the square root value when checking divisors.

Would you like me to show how to visualize what range() produces for any number (like print all i values for a few examples)?

what if fibonacci
ChatGPT said:
Nice 👏 — the Fibonacci series is another classic!
Let’s go step-by-step like before and write clean versions in Python, and I’ll explain the logic and for loop clearly again.

🧩 What is Fibonacci?
It’s a series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

Example:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
→ Starts with 0 and 1
→ Next = 0 + 1 = 1
→ Then 1 + 1 = 2
→ Then 1 + 2 = 3
→ etc.

✅ Python Program: Fibonacci using for
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1  # starting two numbers
    for i in range(n):
        print(a, end=" ")
        a, b = b, a + b  # shift forward
fibonacci(8)
🧠 Output:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
🔍 Explanation of for i in range(n):
Let’s say n = 8.

range(8) produces → [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

So loop runs 8 times.

Iteration (i)	a	b	Printed	New a	New b
0	0	1	0	1	1
1	1	1	1	1	2
2	1	2	1	2	3
3	2	3	2	3	5
4	3	5	3	5	8
5	5	8	5	8	13
6	8	13	8	13	21
7	13	21	13	21	34
After 8 iterations, you get the first 8 Fibonacci numbers.

💡 Alternate version (returns a list instead of printing):
def fibonacci(n):
    seq = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        seq.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return seq

print(fibonacci(8))
Output:

[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
Would you like me to show the recursive version of Fibonacci next (the one that calls itself)?

ChatGPT said:
Excellent catch — this one’s subtle 😄
You’re trying to generate Fibonacci numbers, but your syntax has a logic and syntax issue in JavaScript.
Let’s go through it carefully 👇

❌ Your code
function isprime(n){
    let a,b=0,1;
    for (let i=0;i<n;i++){
        console.log(a,b);
        a,b=b,a+b;
    }
}
isprime(7);
🚨 Problems:
Variable declaration is wrong:

let a,b=0,1;
In JS, this means:

b = 0

a = undefined

and the trailing ,1 just gets ignored.

✅ Correct way:

let a = 0, b = 1;
The line a,b=b,a+b; doesn’t do what you think.

In JS, the comma operator evaluates both sides and returns the last value.

So a,b=b,a+b; just evaluates to the last expression (a+b) and throws away the rest — it doesn’t assign properly.

✅ Correct way:
You need array destructuring assignment:

[a, b] = [b, a + b];
✅ Corrected code:
function fibonacci(n) {
    let a = 0, b = 1;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        console.log(a, b);
        [a, b] = [b, a + b];
    }
}

fibonacci(7);

🔍 Summary of fixes:

print(fibonacci(8))
ChatGPT said:
Excellent observation 👏 — and you’re absolutely right!
That’s because Python and JavaScript treat comma-separated assignments very differently.

Let’s understand exactly why it works in Python but not in JavaScript 👇

🐍 In Python — “tuple unpacking” or multiple assignment
When you write:

a, b = b, a + b
➡️ Python automatically:

Creates a tuple on the right: (b, a + b)

Then unpacks it into the variables on the left.

So if before this line:

a = 0, b = 1
then after:

a = 1
b = 1
✅ Works perfectly — Python knows to evaluate the right side first, store it temporarily, and then assign both at once.

💻 In JavaScript — commas ≠ multiple assignment
When you wrote:

a,b = b,a+b;
JavaScript doesn’t see that as two assignments.
It sees the comma operator, which means:

“Evaluate a, then evaluate b = b, then evaluate a + b, and return the last value.”

So only the last value is actually used.
No multiple assignment happens.

That’s why your JS version broke.

✅ JavaScript correct way — “array destructuring”
[a, b] = [b, a + b];
Here:

[b, a + b] creates an array.

Then [a, b] = ... unpacks values into a and b.
This mimics Python’s multiple assignment behavior.

🔍 Summary:
Language	Syntax	Mechanism	Works?
Python	a, b = b, a + b	Tuple unpacking	✅ Yes
JavaScript	a, b = b, a + b	Comma operator (not unpacking)	❌ No
JavaScript (correct)	[a, b] = [b, a + b]	Array destructuring	✅ Yes
So your Python code worked because Python natively supports multiple assignment — something JavaScript only supports through destructuring.

Would you like me to show how both versions internally update the values step-by-step (to see what happens to a and b at each iteration)?

You said:
Summary

js evaluate from left to right?
ChatGPT said:
Excellent — that’s a really sharp and important question 👏

Let’s clear it up precisely:

⚙️ JavaScript does evaluate expressions left → right,
but the comma operator and assignment order make things tricky.

🧩 Example:
a = 5;
b = 10;
a, b = b, a + b;
You might think it swaps values like in Python — but nope.

Let’s see what JavaScript actually does step-by-step 👇

🧠 Step-by-step:
The comma operator , means evaluate expressions left to right,
but return the value of the last one.

So a, b = b, a + b; is read as:

a;         // evaluate 'a' (does nothing)
b = b;     // assign 'b' to itself (no change)
a + b;     // evaluate, then discard the value
End result → only the last expression’s value (a + b) matters,
but it’s not assigned anywhere, so the line has no real effect.

That’s why your Fibonacci logic didn’t work with plain commas.

✅ Correct version (why this works)
[a, b] = [b, a + b];
[b, a + b] creates an array on the right.

JavaScript evaluates both elements first (left → right).

Then destructures them simultaneously into [a, b].

So the old a value is still used to compute a + b, and both get updated together — same as Python’s behavior.

⚖️ Summary
Concept	Python	JavaScript
Evaluation order	Left → right	Left → right
, meaning	Tuple unpacking	Comma operator
Multiple assignment	Built-in	Only via destructuring ([a,b]=[b,a+b])
Works for Fibonacci swap?	✅ Yes	❌ No, unless destructuring
So yes — JavaScript evaluates left to right,
but because of how the comma operator and assignment binding work,
your a,b=b,a+b line doesn’t behave like Python’s multiple assignment.

Would you like a small visual diagram showing how the destructuring line is evaluated step-by-step?

ChatGPT said:
Excellent 👍 you’re very close — your logic for Fibonacci is correct, but there are a couple of Java syntax and concept errors causing the issue.

Let’s walk through them step by step 👇

❌ Problem 1: fibonacci.fib(res) returns nothing
Your method:

public static void fib(int n) {
    ...
}
has a void return type, meaning it does not return any value.

But in main, you wrote:

System.out.println(fibonacci.fib(res));
⚠️ That’s invalid because you’re trying to print the return value of a function that returns nothing.

✅ Fix:
Either:

Option 1: Don’t print inside main (since fib already prints)

fibonacci.fib(res);
Option 2: Change fib to return something (like a String or List), then print it.

✅ Corrected Version (Option 1 – prints inside fib)
import java.util.Scanner;

class fibonacci {
    public static void fib(int n) {
        int a = 0, b = 1, c;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.println(a);
            c = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = c;
        }
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Try programiz.pro");
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("enter n");
        int res = sc.nextInt();
        
        // ✅ Just call the function — don’t print it
        fibonacci.fib(res);
    }
}
🧠 Example Output:
If input = 7
Output:

Try programiz.pro
enter n
0
1

⚡ Summary of issues fixed:
Issue	What happened	Fix
System.out.println(fibonacci.fib(res));	Tried to print a void method	Just call fibonacci.fib(res);
Variable declaration	OK	no change
Class naming	Good but by convention class names start with capital letter (Fibonacci)	optional fix
Would you like me to modify it so that fib() returns all Fibonacci numbers as a single string (instead of printing line by line)? That’s often how it’s done in Java assignments.

ChatGPT said:
✅ Excellent question — and you’ve written the leap year logic almost perfectly!
Let’s check it carefully with examples 👇

🔹 Your code:
def leapyear(year):
    if year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0:
        return True
    elif year % 400 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

print(leapyear(1900))
🔍 Step-by-step check:
Year	Divisible by 4	Divisible by 100	Divisible by 400	Result
2024	✅	❌	❌	✅ (leap year)
1900	✅	✅	❌	❌ (not leap)
2000	✅	✅	✅	✅ (leap year)
✅ So for 1900, the result should be False — and your code correctly prints:

False
✅ Therefore — your code is 100% correct and logically sound.
💡 Minor stylistic improvement (Pythonic way)
You can simplify it slightly:

def leapyear(year):
    return (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0)

print(leapyear(1900))  # False
print(leapyear(2000))  # True
print(leapyear(2024))  # True
Same logic, just cleaner.

Would you like me to show how to make this accept a range of years (e.g., print all leap years from 1900 to 2100)?

def fact(n):

        return 1;
    else :
        fact(n)*n-1;
print(fact(5));
ChatGPT said:
Good that you’re trying recursion — but yes, your factorial function has a small logic and syntax issue ⚠️

Let’s break it down 👇

❌ Your code
def fact(n):
    if n < 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        fact(n) * n - 1
print(fact(5))
🔍 Problems:
fact(n) * n - 1 → ❌

You’re not calling recursion correctly.

You should call fact(n - 1) — not fact(n) (which causes infinite recursion).

Also, you forgot to return that value.

The base case if n < 0 or n == 1: →

For factorial, negative numbers aren’t defined, so usually you handle that separately.

Base case should really be if n == 0 or n == 1: → return 1.

✅ Correct version
def fact(n):
    if n < 0:
        return "Factorial not defined for negative numbers"
    elif n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * fact(n - 1)

print(fact(5))  # ✅ Output: 120
🧠 Explanation:
fact(5)
= 5 * fact(4)
= 5 * 4 * fact(3)
= 5 * 4 * 3 * fact(2)
= 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * fact(1)
= 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
= 120
Would you like me to show the iterative version (using loop) too?

js includes substring vs python vs java similar or if not its okay teach me with syntax
ChatGPT said:
Excellent question 👏 — you’ve touched on a subtle but very useful concept:
✅ checking whether a substring exists inside a string in JavaScript, Python, and Java.

Let’s compare all three languages side by side 👇

🟡 JavaScript: includes()
✅ Syntax:
string.includes(substring)
✅ Example:
let str = "Hello World";
console.log(str.includes("Hello")); // true
console.log(str.includes("hello")); // false (case-sensitive)
console.log(str.includes("World", 6)); // true (starts search from index 6)
⚙️ Notes:
Case-sensitive

Returns a boolean (true/false)

Optional second argument → start index

🐍 Python: in keyword
✅ Syntax:
substring in string
✅ Example:
text = "Hello World"
print("Hello" in text)   # True
print("hello" in text)   # False (case-sensitive)
print("World" in text)   # True
⚙️ Notes:
Easiest and cleanest syntax

Also case-sensitive

Returns a boolean

You can also use .find() or .index():

text.find("World")  # returns 6
text.find("moon")   # returns -1 (if not found)
☕ Java: .contains()
✅ Syntax:
string.contains(substring)
✅ Example:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "Hello World";
        System.out.println(str.contains("Hello")); // true
        System.out.println(str.contains("hello")); // false
    }
}
⚙️ Notes:
Returns a boolean

Case-sensitive

Belongs to the String class in Java (java.lang.String)

🧩 Summary Table
Feature	JavaScript	Python	Java
Method / Keyword	includes()	in	.contains()
Case-sensitive	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Return Type	Boolean	Boolean	Boolean
Can specify start index?	✅ Yes (str.includes(sub, start))	⚠️ Not directly	⚠️ Not directly
Example	str.includes("a")	"a" in str	str.contains("a")
Would you like me to also show how to make it case-insensitive in all three languages (so “hello” matches “Hello”)?

You said:
if let say start=1 and i m returning start++ so what value it print it was telling 1 i thought 2
ChatGPT said:
Ah! This is a classic confusion with the post-increment operator (++) in JavaScript (and many other languages). Let’s clarify carefully 👇

1️⃣ The operators
start++ → post-increment

Returns the current value of start, then increments it.

++start → pre-increment

Increments start first, then returns the new value.

🔹 Example:
let start = 1;

console.log(start++);  // post-increment
console.log(start);    // check new value
Step-by-step:

Step	start	Expression	Returned / Printed
1	1	start++	1
2	2	—	—
First console.log(start++) → prints 1 (original value)

After that line, start becomes 2

let start = 1;

console.log(++start);  // pre-increment
Prints 2, because start is incremented before returning

✅ Summary:
Operator	Returns	Side Effect
start++	Current value (then increments)	start increases by 1
++start	Value after increment	start increases by 1
So in your case:

let start = 1;
return start++;
The function returns 1, but start itself becomes 2 after the return (though the returned value is still 1).

If you want, I can draw a simple diagram showing post vs pre increment — it makes this super intuitive. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
is this behavior same for java and python?
ChatGPT said:
Great follow-up! Let’s analyze post-increment behavior in JavaScript, Java, and Python.

1️⃣ JavaScript
let start = 1;
console.log(start++); // prints 1
console.log(start);   // now start = 2
console.log(++start); // prints 3
✅ Post-increment x++ → returns current value, then increments.

✅ Pre-increment ++x → increments first, then returns.

2️⃣ Java
int start = 1;
System.out.println(start++); // prints 1
System.out.println(start);   // 2
System.out.println(++start); // 3
Works exactly like JavaScript

Post-increment returns original value, then increments.

Pre-increment increments first, then returns.

3️⃣ Python
⚠️ Python does NOT have ++ or -- operators at all.

start = 1
start++  # ❌ SyntaxError
To increment in Python, you must do:

start = 1
start += 1  # increments by 1
Python always requires explicit assignment; there’s no post/pre increment behavior.

✅ Summary Table
Language	Post-increment x++	Pre-increment ++x	Notes
JavaScript	Returns current, then increments	Increments, then returns	✔
Java	Same as JS	Same as JS	✔
Python	❌ Not available	❌ Not available	Use x += 1 instead
So in short:

JS & Java: behave the same, x++ returns old value.

Python: no ++ operator, must use +=.

If you want, I can make a visual diagram comparing post/pre increment in JS & Java vs Python — it makes it very easy to remember.

Do you want me to do that?
