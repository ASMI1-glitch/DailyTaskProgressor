1. Why Do We Need Blockchain?
Blockchain enables secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions without intermediaries. It ensures data integrity and trust in decentralized systems.

2. What Are Bitcoin and Blockchain?
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, while blockchain is the underlying technology—a distributed ledger recording all transactions across a network.

3. How Does Blockchain Work?
Blockchain stores data in blocks linked chronologically. Each block contains transaction data, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, ensuring immutability.

7. Use Case: Blockchains and Banks
Banks use blockchain for faster cross-border payments, reducing fraud, and improving compliance through transparent and immutable records.

8. Ethereum
Ethereum is a decentralized platform enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to run without downtime or third-party interference.

9. Features of Ethereum
Smart Contracts: Self-executing contracts with coded terms.

Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM): Runs decentralized applications.

Ether (ETH): Native cryptocurrency used for transactions and computational services.

10. Cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, operating independently of a central authority.

11. Smart Contract
A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the agreement terms directly written into code, executing automatically when conditions are met.

12. Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
The EVM is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum, enabling code execution exactly as intended.

13. Ethereum Virtual Machine - Gas
Gas is the fee required to conduct a transaction or execute a contract on Ethereum, compensating for computational energy.

14. Applications of Ethereum
Ethereum supports various applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and supply chain management.

15. Why Smart Contract?
Smart contracts automate and enforce agreements without intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing efficiency.

16. What Is a Smart Contract?
A smart contract is a digital agreement that automatically executes and enforces terms when predefined conditions are met.

17. Advantages of Smart Contract
Automation: Reduces manual intervention.

Trust: Code enforces terms.

Efficiency: Faster execution and settlement.

Cost-Effective: Eliminates intermediaries.

18. Use Case - Crowdfunding Smart Contract
Smart contracts can automate fundraising by releasing funds only when certain conditions are met, ensuring transparency and trust.

19. What Is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank, allowing peer-to-peer transactions over the blockchain network.

20. Advantages of Bitcoin
Decentralization: No central authority.

Limited Supply: 21 million coins cap.

Security: Strong cryptographic protocols.

Transparency: Public ledger of transactions.

21. Concepts of Bitcoin Mining
Bitcoin mining involves validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain, rewarding miners with new bitcoins.

22. Blockchain Wallet
A blockchain wallet allows users to store and manage cryptocurrencies, providing access to funds through private keys.

23. Why Blockchain Wallet?
Blockchain wallets offer secure, decentralized storage for cryptocurrencies, giving users control over their funds.

24. How Do Blockchain Wallets Work?
They use public and private keys to send and receive cryptocurrencies, recording transactions on the blockchain.

25. Features of Blockchain Wallet
Security: Encrypted access.

User Control: Private key ownership.

Accessibility: Available on various devices.

Transparency: Transaction history visible on the blockchain.

29. Software Wallet - Desktop Wallet
Installed on a personal computer, offering control over keys but susceptible to malware if the computer is compromised.

30. Software Wallet - Online Wallet
Accessible through web browsers, convenient but potentially vulnerable to phishing and hacking attacks.

31. Software Wallet - Mobile Wallet
Smartphone applications providing on-the-go access to cryptocurrencies, balancing convenience with security features.

32. Hardware Wallet
A physical device storing private keys offline, offering enhanced security against online threats.

33. Paper Wallet
A physical printout of public and private keys, providing offline storage but requiring careful handling to prevent loss or damage.

34. Blockchain Wallets Comparison
Each wallet type balances security and convenience differently; users should choose based on their needs and risk tolerance.

35. Bitcoin vs. Ethereum
Bitcoin: Primarily a digital currency.

Ethereum: A platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts.
