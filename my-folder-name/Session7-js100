Ah! Now I see exactly whatâ€™s happening â€” your code **still calculates wrong values** because of this line inside your function:

```python
sum = sum + i
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Problem

* `i` is **the index** (0, 1, 2, â€¦)
* You want to add the **actual numbers** entered by the user: `a[i]`
* Right now, youâ€™re adding only 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
* Average = 10 Ã· 5 = 2.0 âœ… matches the output you got

---

### ðŸ”§ Fix

Change your function to add the **elements of the array**:

```python
def avg(a):
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        total = total + a[i]  # <--- use a[i], not i
    average = total / len(a)
    return average
```

---

### âœ… Full Corrected Program:

```python
print("Try programiz.pro")

n = int(input("Enter the number: "))

def avg(a):
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        total += a[i]      # add the actual numbers
    average = total / len(a)
    return average

arr = []
i = 0
while i < n:
   num = int(input(f"Enter number {i+1}: "))
   arr.append(num)
   i += 1

print("Average:", avg(arr))
```

---

### ðŸ’¡ Sample Run

```
Try programiz.pro
Enter the number: 5
Enter number 1: 45
Enter number 2: 65
Enter number 3: 56
Enter number 4: 89
Enter number 5: 45
Average: 60.0
```

If you want, I can also show an **even simpler version** using Pythonâ€™s `sum()` and `len()` in **just 3 lines of logic**.
Do you want me to do that?
